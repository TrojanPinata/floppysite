# What is this?
This is the first iteration of my personal site which is written in HTML and uses minimal backend (for the time being). The goal of this project is to make a consistant web app which is small enough to run off a floppy disk.

Eventually, I will be implementing actual scripts and such to make this run smoother and look better, as well as SSL certificates and overall better design. The first version of this is basically just some HTML and a few lines of CSS to pretty it up.

This repo is the working repository for this project. All changes made here will eventually be reflected on the actual site after they are tested and verified. The whole system is essentially air gapped from unintentional errors due to the nature of Github development and local storage.

All images are either made by me or taken from a Win 9X system. Most images are hosted through Imgur, as to minimize storage requirments.
