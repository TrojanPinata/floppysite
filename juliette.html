            <h3>Headphones are cool I guess</h3>

            <p>Man I sure do love headphones.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Yeah, thats about it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>JK. But I really do love headphones. This has become my hobby for the past few years, and I wanted to try my hand at making them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Maybe around 2016? Early 2017? I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q">Wintergatan's Marble Machine</a> video and I absolutely fell in love. I spent hours going over Martin's videos and as a broke high school student, I really wanted to be like him. In that original video, Martin wears a pair of white Juliette SH-7502's, most likely painted, with original drivers and cable. I did some research and found a pair for just under $25, bought them up and even went out of my way to buy an adapter for my phone at the time. When they arrived, they sounded awful. Just dreadful. And I wore them maybe once before covid. And then I had a night, sometime during that summer, where I put them back on and watched the Wintergatan video again and in a wave of inspiration, set out to make them actually good.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>First things first, how did I go about doing that. Well to start, I felt really guilty about pulling a pair of vintage headphones out of the market and I really wanted to have some preservation factor, so I bought another pair. This time for a whole $9. Beige, spider-webbed and somehow even more unusable then the first pair, I cracked them open and ripped the drivers out. I really like the beige look, and I would not be against having an off-white or beige PC case one day (maybe taking an old beige box and making it into a sleeper? future project??). The original 8 Ohm drivers were a little large and really didn't fit my target specs, so I removed them and went to buy new ones. At the time, I didn't have a job, so everything was paid for on a hard budget. I decided on some AKG 701 replica drivers for something like $47, and even though these cans weren't open backs, I felt like they might still work. I was able to reuse the original headband wire and structure, but everything else needed to be gutted. So, to recap, new drivers, new pads (because while I haven't talked about them, take my word for it they weren't the pillowy goodness that is 21st century pads), and hell, while we're at it, a 2.5mm jack to plug in my Audio-Technica M50x's short cable. This made these great for walking around campus due to their cable, lightness, and (sort of) low bass.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After about two weeks of waiting, I got all of my components and started putting them together. My drivers were just smaller than the original ones, so I had to use strips of cardboard to seat them properly. Even now, a year and a half later, I haven't glued them down properly. Just cardboard and the back case keeping them in check. Everything soldered together fine, and the female jack went in fine, but it didn't fit the cable hole. It was actually too wide and too long. I had to make some nasty cuts but the whole thing fit in well, and due to my pad of choice being OEM M50x pads, I simply buffed down the tabs that hold them on and let the mesh in the middle of the pads cover up my negligence to beauty.</p>

            <br>
            <p>And with that, yeah, they're done. I debated 3d printing some of the parts for this, but I really didn't want a sort of Theseus's ship, so all original frame and decently sounding system. I definitely should have been more careful with the drivers, as low bass really kills them, but I really enjoyed doing this. I was sent another pair of 701 drivers by mistake as well as some Beyerdynamic's (not sure what model they are for though) and I think if I do this again, I will make a whole set from scratch out of ABS. I bought a pair of Lafayette Model F-990's and I wanted to do this again, but they are truly unmoddable with their literal 100mm+ speaker drivers. Regardless, I really enjoyed this project and this remains one of my favorite projects to date.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Until next time.</p>
