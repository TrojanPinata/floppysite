            <p>I have a keyboard. It is very nice. I got it on sale in spring 2016 from amazon. I don't know what else to say about it. It's a Corsair K70 (MK1 with the Cherry MX Speed keys). It's got the RGB, the media keys, the 100% layout what more could you want?</p>
            <br>
            <p>There really is only so much you can really do with a keyboard. It is essential for using a computer, or at least it was for a while when touch screens wern't popular. I think keyboards are really nice, and thats why I have more then just one. I also have a IBM Model M. It's very old, loud, and very very clicky. I like it too. It lives on my side desk and runs on my secondary PC. The thing these two have in common are that they <i>are</i> common. Not too common, but enough that other people have them. This is where I started getting interested in mechanical keyboards. I saw them on reddit for the longest time and I thought they we're cool but way too expensive. Like you can literally find some averaging upwards of $400, and that immediately prices most people out. There are some kits for much cheaper, but I feel like they take the reigns away from the user and give you everything too prepackaged. The <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black?_fd=0">GMMK Pro</a> is about $300 (with everything) and looks good. I was going to buy one for a while, but when you’re spending the big bucks like that you might as well get everything, y’know?</p>
            <br>
            <p>So, I forgot about all of this and set it aside for a year before I decided to make my own. <a href="https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide">This guide</a> is really helpful. It breaks everything down into easy-to-understand blocks and explains proper form for designing and simplifying PCBs and general layouts. This is where I started. I was messing around trying to decide on what I wanted to do. I actually gave up after reading this because I didn’t know.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This hobby has so many different things and styles to build off of it is overwhelming. Initially, I gave up and just wanted to buy a kit, where all you need to do is solder everything together. But in my head, I couldn’t justify buying anything. There are too many different styles that exist. I eventually narrowed it down to the <a href="https://www.cftkb.com/shop/mysterium-tkl-diy-keyboard-kit">CFTKB Mysterium</a> because of how exposed the PCB is or <a href="https://cannonkeys.com/products/gb-satisfaction-75-keyboard-round-2">CannonKeys Satisfaction75</a> for its rotary encoder and OLED screen, but they are both out of stock. This a common trend in the market, and I hate it. I refuse to wait a year for a person with very little incentive to rerelease to put out more, so I now had a reason to do it myself.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My game plan was to use the knowledge from the guide and combine the features of the two together to make something better than the sum of their parts. I knew I liked how the Mysterium was built, and it had <a href="https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/mysterium">open-source files</a>, so I got to work. There are many iterations that will never see the light of day. Never. They are bad. I would spend an entire day working on one and then at the end discard the whole thing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I then discovered <a href="https://github.com/Envious-Data/Env-KB">Envious-Data’s Delierium</a>. It is a unique keyboard in that it utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico, a relatively new microcontroller on the market, and merges it with the Mysterium to get a easy to design result with my style. So, I decided to merge all three keyboards into something I could actually use. I ended up with a 75% keyboard with all of the features I wanted on one PCB with some bonus’s like having a button for the power LED and a through-hole (THT) USB-C connector. I am skipping a lot of the finer details, so I do apologize if some stuff gets left out. This project took literally months.</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>At this point, I was disenchanted with the whole project, and I didn’t really want to continue working on it so I started fiddling around with the firmware side of everything. I had initially wanted to use <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware">QMK</a>, but after seeing that it did not support the Pico yet, I was forced to use <a href="https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware">KMK</a>, which in the end was actually easier to use and bug fix. There is so much on this side, but what it comes down to is that their <a href="http://kmkfw.io/">documentation</a> is a bit rough around the edges, but superb in providing examples and information about what features you want to add.</p><a href=""></a>
            <br>
            <p>I posted all of my firmware to <a href="https://github.com/TrojanPinata/Model-K-Pico">Github</a>, and as you can see, I wanted to implement a lot of stuff. I ended up making my own keymaps and layers. Overall, I think it works pretty well. Once I put CircuitPython onto my Pico and built a little proto mechanical keyboard off a breadboard. It became real. I did more bug testing, and then I decided on a whim to run it. I designed a switchplate and backplate, very similar to Envious-Data’s, and sent them out.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was stressful, but after a long wait, here is the result:</p>

            <br>
            <p>Overall, everything runs very smoothly, and I haven’t seen any major problems yet. During assembly, I cracked the 1.5mm acrylic switchplate in a few spots, which sucks, but is primarily hidden by the keycaps so I don’t really notice that much. I couldn’t find the right size screws which forced me to drill out all of the holes. Stuff like that was annoying, but in the end, it left me with a fantastic result I can type stuff like this page with. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I ended up posting this whole thing on <a href="https://github.com/TrojanPinata/Model-K-Pico">Github</a>, so you can see it there. It's called the Model K-Pico as I thought it would be cute to call it something sililar to the Model M, which I love deeply and have had for a really long time. A lot more went into this then I am describing, but I think that would be too much content for this to be interesting. It’s not really necessary for the general audience to know or care why I chose 1.5mm acrylic vs 3mm acrylic or Delrin (cost lol). Anyway, cool project, cool result.</p>
