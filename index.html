            <p>I am a student at George Mason University studying computer engineering. I have background in both computer hardware and software, but primarily focus on hardware utilization and the more "electrical engineering" side while integrating the dynamics and control of software systems.</p>

            <p>You might be curious as to why this site has almost no CSS and why I have not made it all pretty like most other sites used for portfolios. What matters to me is looking at the content of a site/ui rather than the stock graphics and ripped fonts that were on the first page of google. Also, there is basically no backend to this site, as it is running off a 3.5" floppy disk on a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">gen 1 Raspberry Pi Model B</span> <i>Raspberry Pi 3 Model B</i>, which has more ram than the storage it is running on. You can read more about it <a href="hardware.html">here</a>.</p>

            <p>I wanted to do something quirky and cool, so I hope this doesn't come off as uninteresting or tacky at first glance. Thank you for reading all of this, if you wish to contact me, my links are at the bottom of this page.</p>
