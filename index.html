        <div id="center" class="center">
            <p>I am a student at George Mason University studying computer engineering. This is my personal site for posting quick project writeups, pictures, and whatever else I want. This site is currently a work in progress, and I plan to rebuild the whole thing using ReactJS in the future (I’m working on it right now!). For now, it is very barebones so please bear with me. The original version of this site (aka this page) was written to be small enough to fit on a 3.5” double density floppy disk, or 1.44MB, and run on a first-generation Raspberry Pi. Times have changed and it is currently running on a Pi 3 Model B. The major update I am planning on making will further push the site and depending on the changes I make in the design and the necessity of the site, I may change the hardware it is running on for better efficiency and usefulness. My original writeup for this site is sort of preserved <a href="hardware.html">here</a>. </p>

            <p>I wanted to do something quirky and cool, so I hope this doesn't come off as uninteresting or tacky at first glance. Thank you for reading all of this, if you wish to contact me, my links are at the bottom of this page.</p>
