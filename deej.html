            <h1><b>DEEJ</b></h1>
            <br>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/omriharel/deej">deej</a> is a DIY mixer for windows which implements simple Arduino logic and a simple go program to control system and application output volume.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I already did a sort of build write-up before, so I will spare my fingers by linking the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4897132">thingiverse post</a> and the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/BKJjUsq">imgur album</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, it has already been a few months and I can say without a shadow of a doubt, this was one of the most useless things I've ever created. There is no need for this in my workflow. The sliders were always unbalanced and thus aesthetically annoying, and overall, I had no use for this thing taking up space on my desk. So, I wanted to used potentiometers this time and make the whole thing smaller.</p>

            <br>
            <p>So, redo it with multiple designs, knobs, white finish to match pc, and small form factor that fits anywhere. Oh, and USB C as a cherry on top.</p>

            <!-- The picture is bad because I originally wasn't hosting my files and was storing them locally and they needed to be really small. I didn't realize this until after it was deployed and I had changed phones. I'll update them next time.-->

            <br>
            <p>Utterly useless. I now have three deej models made and I never use them. It's another background program to run and overall, I don't like not being able to use any other means of changing my volume. If I do this again, I'm going to write a program that works on driver level which utilizes more of a scroll wheel functionality and scrolls forever, just so I can still change the volume in software. But of course, by that time, I'll probably have archived my DIY Mic and bought a Shure SM7B with a Yamaha AG06, so I won't really have any use to changing my I/O volume.</p>

            <br>
            <p>In the mean time however, this scroll wheel puts all three of them out of business</p>
            <br>
            <p>Until next time.</p>
